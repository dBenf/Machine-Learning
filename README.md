# Machine-Learning
This repository contains the solutions proposed for the three Mini-Contests of the **Machine Learning** course (AY 21/22) at the *University of Naples Federico II*.

## Contest 1 : Machine Learning for Prostate Cancer Detection
[mini-contest1](https://github.com/dBenf/Machine-Learning/mini-contest1) directory contains the solution proposed for the first Mini-Contest, which is a **classification** problem that should be solved with traditional *Machine Learning* techniques. The aim of the contest is to detect prostate cancer in patients with PI-RADS score 3 lesions considering clinical-radiological characteristics and avoiding prostate biopsy.

## Contest 2 : Machine Learning & energy transition
[mini-contest2](https://github.com/dBenf/Machine-Learning/mini-contest2) directory contains the solution proposed for the second Mini-Contest, which is a **regression** problem that should be solved with traditional *Machine Learning* techniques. The aim of the contest is to predict the Oxygen/Carbon ratio (numeric prediction) for a given raw feedstock sample described by its properties and characteristics.

## Contest 3 : Detection of Warning Bells at Level Crossings
[mini-contest3](https://github.com/dBenf/Machine-Learning/mini-contest3) directory contains the solution proposed for the third Mini-Contest, which is a **sound classification** problem that should be solved with traditional *Machine Learning* techniques. The aim of the contest is to detect whether a given sound sample belongs to a warning bell at level crossings or not (multi-class classification).
